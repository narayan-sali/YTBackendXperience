# joyful backend 
 This is the backend project using nodejs,expressjs and mongodb
Here's a step-by-step documentation on how to set up a professional backend

Install VS Code (Visual Studio Code):
------------------

Download and install Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor, on your local system.

Install Node.js:
------------------
Install Node.js on your local system, which is required for running JavaScript on the server side. You can download it from the official Node.js website.

Open Visual Studio Code:
------------------
Launch Visual Studio Code to begin working on your project.

Configure Git:
------------------
Set up Git integration in Visual Studio Code if not already configured.

Create a Git Repository:
------------------
Use Git to create a repository for your project with the name "nasa-backend."

Create Project Structure:
------------------
Inside your project directory, create a folder named "Public."
Inside the "Public" folder, create another folder called "temp."
In the "temp" folder, create a file named .gitkeep.

Create .gitignore File:
------------------
Create a file named .gitignore to specify which files or directories should be excluded from version control. You can generate a suitable .gitignore file by searching for "gitignore generator" in your web browser. For example, you can generate one for Node.js projects.

Create .env File:

Create a file named .env for storing environment variables and sensitive information.

Create Source Code Folder:
------------------------------------
Create a folder named "src" to organize your source code.

Inside the "src" Folder:

Open the terminal and navigate to the "src" directory.

Create Key Project Files:
------------------
Inside the "src" directory, create the following key files:
app.js
constants.js
index.js

Update package.json:

Open your project's package.json file and ensure it includes the "type" field set to "module."

Install Nodemon:
------------------
In the terminal, install Nodemon as a development dependency using the following command:
css
Copy code
npm i -D nodemon


Update package.json for Development:

Update the "scripts" section in the package.json file to include a "dev" script that uses Nodemon to run your application. For example:
json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
}


Create Project Structure:
------------------
In the terminal, navigate to your project directory and create the following folders:
controllers
db
middlewares
models
routes
utils

Code Formatting with Prettier:
------------------
To maintain code formatting consistency, use the Prettier extension.
In your project's root directory, install Prettier as a development dependency:
css
Copy code
npm i -D prettier


Create .prettierrc File:

Create a file named .prettierrc in your project's root directory and configure Prettier with your desired settings. For example:
json
Copy code
{
  "singleQuote": false,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5"
}


Create .prettierignore File:

Create a file named .prettierignore in your project's root directory to specify which files and directories should be excluded from Prettier formatting. For example:
bash
Copy code
/.vscode
*.env
.env
.env.*
/node_modules
/dist


With these steps, you'll have a well-structured backend project  set up and ready for development in a professional manner.
